# Loomen
Loomen is a product, made with a team of 7 2nd Year EEE students from Imperial College London, designed to aid injections in hospitals. Loomen achieves this by visualising veins using IR LEDs and a camera coupled with an IR pass filter. The image is then processed and the optimal area to inject is displayed on an iPad.
